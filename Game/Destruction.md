# Attacking

Make targetting simply the closest unit.

Trail bullets.

Soldiers angle their arms to shoot, and if their target is blocked they can't fire.

Allowed to pass through one friendly infantry unit to fire.

# AOE
- Explosions give knockback.
- Try to make lone units capable against packs of units.

# Destruction Effects, Rubble, Recovery

- Water has smoky particles if explosions went off.
- Destroyed ships/planes persist at the bottom of the ocean.
- Building rubble.
- Fracture physics.
- Flash fires from explosions.
- Unit ragdoll and persistence (mind performance).
- Helicopter rudder detatchment

# Recovery

Allow rubble to be excavated and reused or turned into cash.

Particularily would be nice if this is a reward for aggression wherein the attacker lost units due to defenders adv, but could recover it.
But currently it would do the opposite.
