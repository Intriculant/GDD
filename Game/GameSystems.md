# Economy System
- Just like the conquerors, you take control of crystals and place a plant.
- Some crystals could be white, with rainbow lighting effects potentially.
- Oil in the ocean works similarly.
- Deep drills offer a good alternative to crystal income.
- Need to think about economy further.

# Physics-First Gameplay

* Soldiers angle their arms to shoot, and if their target is blocked they can't fire.

* Allowed to pass through one friendly infantry unit to fire.


* Real physics garrison - give units a 'climb' mechanic in order to get
onto transport ships, or fortresses.
Related: units that can't swim well should stay on shore until their
destination (ex. transport ship) arrives in range to climb onto it.


* Humvee/jeep physics such as suspension.

* Waves splash against walls, creating sub waves.

# Transport Plane
- Transport plane/ship physically holds units.
- Plane must land to store and unload units?
- Transport plane can parachute drop (light) tanks and soldiers.
- Light tanks take 5% of health as damage on landing.

# Waypoints

# Move
* Move-Waypoint = a part, and a offset of that part
so that moving geometry can still work with waypoints
imagine building and moving around on a flying fortress, or aircraft carrier
placing turrets on an ac. etc.

Units should constantly try to adjust back to their waypoint.
This is important because inertia will shift units off position on transports.


* Build-Waypoint = either place a building foundation there while building, or work on the foundation already there, if it's what was wanting to be built.
