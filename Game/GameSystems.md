# Economy System

Just like the conquerors, use power plants and oil rigs.

Deep drills offer income for controlling dead spaces of the map.

# Physics.Gameplay

Waves splash against walls, creating sub waves.

# Physics.Inertia

Units should constantly try to adjust back to their waypoint.
This is important because inertia will shift units off position on transports.

Tanks may have more trouble readjusting to their waypoint, but they should have strong friction due to their weight.

# Physics Garrison

- Real physics garrison - give units a 'climb' mechanic in order to get
onto transport ships, or fortresses.
Related: units that can't swim well should stay on shore until their
destination (ex. transport ship) arrives in range to climb onto it.

- Transport planes likely must land to garrison.
- Transport plane could parachute drop (light) tanks and soldiers, with light tanks taking damage on landing.

- Humvee/jeep physics such as suspension.

# Waypoints

# Move

Coordinate: (Part, Vector_Offset)

This allows placing waypoints on moving targets.

Imagine building and moving around on a Flying Fortress, or Aircraft Carrier


# Build

Either place a building foundation there while building, or work on the foundation already there, if it's what was wanting to be built.
