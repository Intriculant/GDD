# Boarding

Real physics garrison - give units a 'climb' mechanic in order to get
onto transport ships, planes, or fortresses.

Related: units that can't swim well should stay on shore until their
destination (ex. transport ship) arrives in range to climb onto it.

Transport planes likely must land to garrison.

Transport plane could parachute drop (light) tanks and soldiers, with light tanks taking damage on landing.

# Waypoint.Move

Coordinate: (Part, Vector_Offset)

This allows placing waypoints on moving targets.

Imagine building and moving around on a Flying Fortress, or Aircraft Carrier.
