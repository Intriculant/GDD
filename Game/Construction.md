# Weapon.AttackPosition(Coordinate, BlueprintName?)
- This is the method that allows a unit (weapon) to construct at a location, or help construct.

# Construction
- Allow semi-complete constructions to move, such as an ac with a builder on top of it.
- A foundation is dropped when constructing buildings.
- The range of a constructor is determined by the weapon range.
- Line of sight is required.
- Builds are progressed per-part.

# Production
- Production buildings have a specific local spot that they construct at, and it can't be changed.
- They also can't help with other construction projects.
