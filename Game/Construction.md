# Builders and building

* Build things by placing fragments of the unit.
The builder could move around to these fragments, or atleast point the build
tool towards them.

* Buildings must be manually placed at a position.
Soldiers and infantry could be manually placed, but would most likely
be built inside of the production building.

* Builders need to be close to the build site to build, and can't build up hills.

* Train inside buildings?
