# Gameplay

Waves splash against walls, creating sub waves.

Humvee/jeep physics such as suspension.

# Inertia

Units should constantly try to adjust back to their waypoint.
This is important because inertia will shift units off position on transports.

Tanks may have more trouble readjusting to their waypoint, but they should have strong friction due to their weight.

# Gravity
Custom gravity - stick on walls.

Mecha with a piggy-back spot that any infantry can attach to.

Different hues for buildings, navy, and infantry - hue shifts while losing hp.

Builders drop down a foundation.
