# Details
- Waves splash against walls, creating sub waves.
- Humvee/jeep physics such as suspension.

# Inertia
- Units should constantly try to adjust back to their waypoint.
- This is important because inertia will shift units off position on transports.
- Tanks may have more trouble readjusting to their waypoint.
- But they should have strong friction due to their weight.

# Gravity
- Custom gravity - stick on walls.

# Boarding
- Real physics garrison - give units a 'climb' mechanic.
- Transport planes likely must land to garrison.
- Transport plane could parachute drop (light) tanks and soldiers, with light tanks taking damage on landing.
