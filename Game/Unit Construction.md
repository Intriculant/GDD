# Waypoint.Build

Either place a building foundation there while building, or work on the foundation already there, if it's what was wanting to be built.

# Builders and building

Build things by placing fragments of the unit.
The builder could move around to these fragments, or atleast point the build
tool towards them.

Builders need to be close to the build site to build, and can't build up hills.

Train inside buildings?


 
Because builders hold the blueprint while building, other builders
can look at it to know what to build, without needing to embed the data into the
build site.

If an ac is built enough to be sailable, the rest of the build can be done while
the ship is already beginning to sail.

So certain aspects of a unit's functions can be given at different completion steps.



# Walls

Work on a hexagonal grid system.
Takes builders some time to put up, but are strong and good for blocking
regions of the map.

Walls should be hard to break through without an aoe attack.
Making small holes to bypass shouldn't work.
Perhaps damage should spread out evenly to nearby walls when attacked to
help with this.

Since any building produces rubble, maybe this is the mechanism that walls use
to block things. Then they do not need a high hp pool.
