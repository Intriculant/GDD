# Rare Actions
- Soldiers take a drink of water very rarely,
  and drop their bottle if they enter combat while drinking.
- Medics pull out and roll up a bandage.

# Walls

Work on a hexagonal grid system.
Takes builders some time to put up, but are strong and good for blocking
regions of the map.

Walls should be hard to break through without an aoe attack.
Making small holes to bypass shouldn't work.
Perhaps damage should spread out evenly to nearby walls when attacked to
help with this.

# Unit Ideas
- Marines that can wade through water (for some time).
- A long ranged sniper variant.
- A sea unit that can produce disruptive waves.
- Western inspired unit.
- AT-AT inspired.
- Sarlacc inspired unit.
- Big-wheeled mobile tank.
- Building 'liftoff' tag - allows it to toggle flying and landed. Landing enables other effects?
- Reintroduce the blimp - a mobile barracks?
- Pop-up turret.

mecha
  - A medium to large sized mechanical humanoid.
titan
  - A much MUCH larger mecha that can walk through the sea.
jetpack builder
  - A builder variant that can fly up onto hills to build, but has less build power.
unit that can harvest and reuse dead bodies? maybe alien.
make a unit that can pick up and move buildings to reposition them
flying saucer
jumping unit - A unit that has a jump to position (w/ physics) ability.
  Would make sense as a suicidal mine.
Long Legs - A spider styled unit.

# jetpacker
can jump over hills
has a 'jump up' ability that can dodge a missile
can float over water
when floating, it's targettable by anti air
physics based, and makes a wind effect on the ground
