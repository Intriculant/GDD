# Day/Night Cycle
- Large building spotlights at night.
- Moonlight at night.
- Glowing jellyfish at night.
- Vehicle spotlights.
- Plane spotlights, and lighting on the planes.

# Economy System
- Just like the conquerors, you take control of crystals and place a plant.
- Some crystals could be white, with rainbow lighting effects potentially.
- Oil in the ocean works similarly.
- Deep drills offer a good alternative to crystal income.
- Need to think about economy further.

# Physics-First Gameplay

* Soldiers angle their arms to shoot, and if their target is blocked they can't fire.

* Allowed to pass through one friendly infantry unit to fire.


* Real physics garrison - give units a 'climb' mechanic in order to get
onto transport ships, or fortresses.
Related: units that can't swim well should stay on shore until their
destination (ex. transport ship) arrives in range to climb onto it.


* Humvee/jeep physics such as suspension.

* Waves splash against walls, creating sub waves.

# Transport Plane Physics
- Transport plane/ship physically holds units.
- Plane must land to store and unload units?
- Transport plane can parachute drop (light) tanks and soldiers.
- Light tanks take 5% of health as damage on landing.

# Waypoints

* Move-Waypoint = a part, and a offset of that part
so that moving geometry can still work with waypoints
imagine building and moving around on a flying fortress, or aircraft carrier
placing turrets on an ac. etc.

* Build-Waypoint = either place a building foundation there while building, or work on the foundation already there, if it's what was wanting to be built.

# Builders and building

* Build things by placing fragments of the unit.
The builder could move around to these fragments, or atleast point the build
tool towards them.

* Buildings must be manually placed at a position.
Soldiers and infantry could be manually placed, but would most likely
be built inside of the production building.

* Builders need to be close to the build site to build, and can't build up hills.

* Train inside buildings?

# Attacking
Make targetting simply the closest unit.
Trail bullets.

# AOE
- Explosions give knockback.
- Try to make lone units capable against packs of units.

# Destruction Effects, Rubble, Recovery

- Water has smoky particles if explosions went off.
- Destroyed ships/planes persist at the bottom of the ocean.
- Building rubble.
- Fracture physics.
- Flash fires from explosions.
- Unit ragdoll and persistence.
- Helicopter rudder detatchment


# Recovery

Allow rubble to be excavated and reused or turned into cash.

Particularily would be nice if this is a reward for aggression wherein the attacker lost units due to defenders adv, but could recover it.
But currently it would do the opposite.
